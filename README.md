# # Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from Scratch

This project showcases the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) entirely from scratch, without utilizing any deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. The goal of this project was to gain a deeper understanding of the inner workings of CNNs and to demonstrate the process of building a neural network from the ground up.

## Project Overview

In this project, I have designed and implemented a CNN architecture to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST database. The MNIST dataset is a widely recognized benchmark for evaluating the performance of machine learning models for image classification tasks.

## Results

The CNN from scratch achieves an impressive accuracy of approximately 88% on the MNIST dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of the custom implementation. Keep in mind that this project prioritizes educational purposes over maximizing performance, so there may be room for improvement in terms of accuracy through further optimizations.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the process of building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch, without relying on established deep learning frameworks. By achieving an accuracy of approximately 88% on the MNIST dataset, it showcases the effectiveness of the custom CNN implementation for image classification tasks.
